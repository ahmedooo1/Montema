Progress guidelines:
- Track the todo list with the manage_todo_list tool and mark steps once done.
- Keep explanations concise; mention when steps are skipped.
- Use the current folder as root for all commands and scaffolding.
- Do not install extensions unless explicitly provided by get_project_setup_info.
- Avoid adding media or integrations unless requested; use placeholders only when noted.
- Provide clear run/lint/build instructions when work is finished.
